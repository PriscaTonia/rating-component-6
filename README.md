## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about using css flex properties to better make my code responsive and reduce css styles that were written. I also got to practice Javascript DOM manipulation to add event listeners and change up my styles.

### Continued development

I would love to continue learning more css flexibility and awesome styles, as well as practice more javascripts codes. And hopefully, learn and effectively use JavaScript frame works.
